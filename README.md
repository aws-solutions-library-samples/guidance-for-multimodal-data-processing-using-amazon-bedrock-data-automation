# Guidance for Multimodal Data Processing Using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation
Automate document processing using AWS AI/ML services to:
- Speed up business processes
- Improve decision quality 
- Reduce operational costs
- Free up expert resources for high-value tasks
cd
This solution uses Amazon Bedrock's Generative AI capabilities to:
1. Classify documents
2. Extract content
3. Process information using foundation models

**Warning: This guidance was developed with the Public Preview of Bedrock Data Automation. With the expected GA launch of BDA, this codebase will need some minor changes to function correctly. The team behind this Solution Guidance is working on these code changes. This warning will be removed once the changes are tested and uploaded to this repo. **

  <summary>Note on dataset and Acceptable End User Policy from the model provider</summary>

The dataset utilized in this guidance consists entirely of synthetic data. This artificial data is designed to mimic real-world information but does not contain any actual personal or sensitive information.

For use cases related to finance and medical insurance as used in this guidance:

Users must adhere to the model provider's Acceptable Use Policy at all times. This policy governs the appropriate use of the synthetic data and associated models, and compliance is mandatory.This synthetic data is provided for testing, development, and demonstration purposes only. It should not be used as a substitute for real data in making financial or medical decisions affecting individuals or organizations.
By using this dataset and guidance, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with all applicable terms, conditions, and policies set forth by the model provider.

## Architecture and Key Features

### Part A: Automated Lending Flow

- Uses Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) for document processing
- Creates reusable document blueprints
- Automatically detects document types
- Extracts relevant information
- Processes results downstream

## Important Notes

### Data Usage
- Solution uses synthetic data only
- No real personal/sensitive information included
- For testing/development purposes only

### Regional Availability

This guidance can be deployed only to AWS regions which have these services available: 

- Amazon Bedrock
- Bedrock Data Exchange
- Bedrock Agents
- Other services noted above

### Service Quotas
Your AWS account has default quotas, also known as service limits, described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html). This guidance can be installed and tested within the default quotas for each of the services used. You can request increases for some quotas. Note that not all quotas can be increased.

To operate this guidance at scale, it is important to monitor your usage of AWS services and configure alarm settings to notify you when a quota is close to being exceeded. You can find details on visualizing your service quotas and setting alarms [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Quotas-Visualize-Alarms.html).
